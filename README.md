# stranger-things-lights
A small ongoing hardware project recreating the lights from "Stranger Things".

### Credits
This was made a long time ago! It was also my first time using Arduinos, and using the C++ language. Parts of the code are from this example for the FastLED library: [ColorPalette.ino](https://github.com/FastLED/FastLED/blob/master/examples/ColorPalette/ColorPalette.ino).
Knowledge of how to take user input came from this [Adafruit tutorial](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-arduino-lesson-5-the-serial-monitor/the-serial-monitor).
