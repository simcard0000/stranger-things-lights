### Credits
This was made a long time ago back in Gr.11, but I plan to keep working on it! It was also my first time using Arduinos, using the C++ language, and the FastLED library. Parts of the code concerning FastLED originate from this example for the FastLED library: [ColorPalette.ino](https://github.com/FastLED/FastLED/blob/master/examples/ColorPalette/ColorPalette.ino) and were learned from sources like the [wiki](https://github.com/FastLED/FastLED/wiki/Controlling-leds). Knowledge of how to take user input came from this [Adafruit tutorial](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-arduino-lesson-5-the-serial-monitor/the-serial-monitor).
